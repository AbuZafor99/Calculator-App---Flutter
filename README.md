Here’s a sample README.md file for your Flutter calculator app:

🧮 My Calculator App

A simple, functional calculator app built with Flutter, capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. It features a clean user interface and supports decimal input, formatted output, and operation history display.

📱 Screenshot

✨ Features
	•	Basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, %
	•	Clear (C) and backspace (X) functions
	•	Decimal number support
	•	Formatted result display (no trailing .0 for integers)
	•	Operation history preview above the result
	•	Responsive and visually clean button layout

🛠️ Technologies Used
	•	Flutter: UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications
	•	Dart: Language used for Flutter development
	•	Custom buildButton widget for reusable buttons

📦 Installation & Run
	1.	Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator_app.git
cd calculator_app


	2.	Install dependencies

flutter pub get


	3.	Run the app

flutter run



📁 File Structure
	•	lib/
	•	main.dart: Main entry point with Calculator_app widget
	•	widget/buildButton.dart: Custom widget for calculator buttons

🔧 Key Functions

buttonPress(String value)

Handles logic for:
	•	Numeric input
	•	Operators
	•	Special keys (C, X, ., =)

_formatOutput(String result)

Cleans up the output for readability:
	•	Removes .0 from integers
	•	Limits decimals to 2 places

🧪 Example Expression

5.0 + 9.0 * 2.0 - 8.0 / 2.0 % 2.0

The app currently calculates one binary operation at a time and does not parse full expressions in one go.

🚀 Future Improvements
	•	Support for full expression evaluation with order of operations
	•	Parentheses support
	•	Scientific mode
	•	History log with scrollable past results
