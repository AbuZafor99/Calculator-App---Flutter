💡 Example Usage

Expression: 5 + 9 * 2 - 8 / 2 % 2

⚠️ This calculator evaluates one operation at a time and does not yet follow order of operations (PEMDAS). It works more like a basic step-by-step calculator.

	•	Support full expression parsing with proper operator precedence
	•	Add parentheses () support
	•	Scrollable history of previous calculations
	•	Dark/light theme toggle
